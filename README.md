# DictProjectGYMStorein-Python
Project Description
This project is a Python-based program that simulates a virtual supplement store named "MyGym-Supplement Store". Users can browse the available products and order their favorite gym supplements. The program allows users to input the item names, calculates the total price for multiple items, and provides a summary of the order.

Features
Displays available supplements and their prices.
Users can order multiple items, with the program calculating the total price.
Handles user inputs to check if the item is available in the store.
Offers an interactive way to place an order using Python.
The program welcomes the user and displays a list of supplements and their prices.
The user can input the name of the product they want to order.
The program checks if the product is available in the store:
If available, it adds the price to the total.
If not, it informs the user that the item is not available.
The user is then given the option to order another item.
After completing the order, the program displays the total cost of the items purchased.
Python: For developing the store simulation logic.
Conditional Statements: To check product availability and calculate the total price.
User Input Handling: To interact with users during the ordering process.
**MOTIVATION*
This project was created as part of my journey transitioning into the Data Science/Analytics world. By working with Python, I learned more about basic programming concepts such as handling user inputs, conditional logic, and building interactive scriptsâ€”skills that are essential for data analysis.**
